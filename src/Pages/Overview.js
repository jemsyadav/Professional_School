            <p>In 2012 the Professional School of Behavioral Health Sciences was organized to offer live, interactive, webinar-based, interdisciplinary degree programs, certificate programs, CE courses, CE workshops, and lectures that bring together physiology and behavioral science for integrated practical applications in healthcare, human service, and performance education.</p>
            <p>In June 2020. the Graduate School was reorganized as the Professional School of Behavioral Health Sciences.  The Professional School replaced the MS degree program with a shorter and more practical professional diploma program in Behavioral Breathing Science.</p>
            <p>The Graduate School trained colleague professionals by interactive webinar from around the world and from diverse professions, including athletics, breathwork, chiropractic, coaching, counseling, dental hygiene, dentistry, education, medicine, mental health, occupational therapy, orthodontics, physiotherapy, psychology, respiratory therapy, social work, and speech therapy.  It graduated its first MS degree and breathing science certification students in 2014.  The Professional School is continuing on with the Vision and Mission of the Graduate School.</p>
            <p>The Professional School prepares professionals to bring these integrative applications directly into their existing practices and businesses or to begin new enterprises based on their professional backgrounds and their newly acquired knowledge and skills.  The Professional School’s goal is to provide working healthcare and performance professionals with new expertise, new practical skills, and requisite business knowledge enabling them to grow their professional practices.</p>
            <p><b>Behavioral</b><strong>&nbsp;Breathing Science&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>The Professional School began with designing and offering programs in applied breathing sciences for empowering experienced, successful practitioners to help people improve health and performance through the application of behavioral learning principles to the physiology of breathing.  To this end, the School recruited a faculty of 16 prominent scientists and clinicians and in 2013 began offering a MS degree program in Applied Breathing Sciences. At the same time the School offered the associated certification program, Certified Breathing Behavior Analyst.  Qualified professionals who do well in the certification program, and who are interested in a career in the field, are invited to enter the Professional Diploma program in Behavioral Breathing Sciences.</p>
            <p>The decision to offer programs in behavioral breathing science was based in part on some astonishing statistics.  Surveys show that as much as 60% of the ambulance runs in major US cities may be the consequence of acute symptoms brought on by dysfunctional breathing habits.  Further, up to 25% of the US population may suffer the effects of learned dysfunctional breathing habits.  Although the enormity of this problem is staggering, conventional healthcare has only superficially addressed the symptoms, and the causes remain virtually ignored.  The breathing science programs offered by the School offer highly effective behavioral solutions to learned dysfunctional breathing, an immense and misunderstood worldwide problem.  These solutions focus on “client-centered” learning rather than “therapist-centered” treatment, where practitioners empower their clients to help themselves</p>
            <p><strong>New Programs</strong></p>
            <p>New practical certificate and diploma programs that bring behavior science together with physiology are under currently development, including behavioral dental science, behavioral physical therapy, and performance training disciplines.</p>
